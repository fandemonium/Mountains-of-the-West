Our great Yellowstone adventure begins! After saying goodbye to the pups, we (Adina, Eveliina, Tomas and I) piled into Lulu, the 2019 Chrysler Pacifica, that would be our home away from home for the next few days. Piled high (well, not too high - I instituted a one carry on, one personal item policy) with luggage and a box of trail snacks, we got rolling around 6:45 heading West from Ames. Destination: Badlands.

The first part of the trip was quite boring. So much so that Adina and Eveliina decided to sleep through it. When that didn't work anymore, we stopped for coffee. Without it, Adina self-proclaimed herself "grumpy" while Tomas went with "angry". I didn't realize that I was living so close to the edge!

Things began to pick-up the second half of the trip with some better scenery. Immense fields gave way to rolling hills, to more sweeping vista's, followed by the emergence of the badlands themselves. With the exception of Adina, it was our collective first time in South Dakota. 

First impression: I'm not sure what it is about the west. The sky is just so much bigger. It seems like someplace as flat as Iowa would be able to match it, but that isn't the case. It isn't even close. I'm not sure if the lack of trees contributes or if there's more to it than that. At any rate, today it was gorgeous. After some morning clouds early in the drive, the sun came out.  We dodged a few pop-up rain showers just outside the badlands, and stayed dry. The sky was a brilliant blue, offset by the fluffy white clouds suspended in it.

While in the Badlands, we did the window trail (super short, but a nice view), the notch trail, which had some good views, and then did the medicine root loop/castle trail combo coming off the saddle pass. It was great scenery all around. 

My favorite was the last hike. It started with a steep scramble up the pass to a high plateau (the sign said settlers often left their wagons at the top and led their teams down individually. It was a challenging up and down for a person - I can't imagine trying to coax an animal to do it!). Once there, we walked out through a high prarie. There were a lot of different grasses interspersed with numerous wildflowers. The air smelled so sweet and clean. You really felt the immensity of the place. On the loop heading back, you walked a lot closer to some of the formations. It was an amazing sight. Some were quite small - appearing both singly as well as in close proximity to others in places. Other formations were immense, with many different layers to them. As you walked, you got to see them from different directions, and each perspective provided another interesting view.

At some places, you were walking on these hard-packed, flat plains that were cut periodically with harsh, sharp draws and washes, before giving over entirely to countless armies of small, densely packed formations. It was surreal - you felt like you were on another planet, not in South Dakota.

Overall, the formations were larger and more impressive than I expected them to be. There was a lot of topography, with different colors of rock, highlighted by lines of contrasting sediment (often red). It was such a bold contrast between the earthy tone of the rock, the immense green plains, and the bright blue sky.

On the way out of the park, we were heading west and watching the early evening sun play off of the surrounding rocks and praries. The animals also seemed to be out enjoying the spectacle. We saw a young whitetail buck, our first prarie dog town (even though the locals probably think that's not worth mentioning), some mountain goats (grazing right by the road! We could see the radio tracking collars on a couple of them.), and a pair of bull bison grazing in a prarie! It was a great exit to a great stay.

After a quick dinner, we piled into the van again, and headed west. Destination: Rapid City, SD and a comfy bed. We arrived around 9:45pm MDT, almost exactly 16 hours after pulling out of Ames.  A full day, we covered 620 miles and ~20,000 iPhone steps (the number is approximate because our phone porter has fallen asleep). It was a great start to our adventure.

I also learned a couple of things. 1) Cacti grow in the cold. I knew that they needed dry but thought that also meant warm. That is not the case - they grow quite well in the Badlands. They were relatively short (< 12" tall), but made for an interesting sight scattered around the landscape. It was good to update my mental model. 2) when hiking with an 18 year old (and/or her 38 year old host mom), trail snacks are a welcome addition to the company's pack, even if it is only a 4 mile hike.
